            <h1>Alisa LarchenCoach</h1>
            <p class="maintext">provides inspirational education to individuals & families with kids seeking clarity and wisdom to build meaningful connections & trust, train soft skills, care & focus.</p>
            <div class="maintext_comment">
                <p>She reminds people of their inner beauty in times of outer chaos. Asks deep questions. Helps with presentation and exam anxiety. Provides structure.</p>
                <p>Being a professional heuristic pedagogue, Alisa shows people the power of their own imagination and solution based thinking. She is a polymath & a creative nerd who loves to melt hearts with humour.</p>
                <p>She speaks and writes about Sensitivity, Mindfulness & the Art of Choice.</p>
                <p>Alisa has worked in the University of Vienna within math department as a sounding board producer in 2022. Previously, she has been studying psychotherapy & gaining experience as an educator in public & private schools, kindergartens and universities around Europe working as a heuristic social pedagogue, producer, coach, art therapist and tutor.</p>
                <p>She has opened her first art-therapy studio in Kyin in 2015 and a second one in 2020.</p>
                <p>Now, she dedicates her time to writing scientific articles and consults people in 3 languages - Ukraininan, Russian and English.</p>
                <p>Her course "The ABC's of feelings" is designed for seekers - usually parents - who wish to learn more about personal effort & time management, distractions, how to avoid burn-out and prevent their child's teenage depression, and just do their best to help kids succeed in life.</p>
                <p>Usually, Alisa's clients first become her friends and then she adds a little extra something - be it her time, patience or expertise - after which mums, paps & kids actually start feeling heard and seen with all their emotions, needs and dreams.</p>
                <p>Only when there is an emotionally safe environment in the family can children truly learn...</p>
                <p>Alisa also develops her start-up in the field of edutech. Education is her gift, technology is a calling, while she sees her mission in organising innovative educational spaces for both - further generations as well as genius adults of the now who seek library-like surroundings to enjoy the quiet & follow their interests that inevitably leads to natural development of Mastery.</p>
